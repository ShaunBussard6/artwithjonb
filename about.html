                                        <p>Jon has been both a fan and creator of art since he was a child, and excelled as a photographer for the majoirty of his professional career. Recently, he has been able to become a full time painter, doing 6X6 pet portraits for Chewy.com. Being an artist full time has been a dream come true for Jon, 
                                                and he has just recently passed 500 paintings in the past year, completing more paintings in one year, than he had in his entire life up to that point. Jon's full time focus on his craft has given him the ability to hone in on his craft, and you can see it in the detail and expert lighting of his paintings.
